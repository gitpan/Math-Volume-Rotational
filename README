Math::Volume::Rotational version 0.10
=====================================

This module calculates the volume of rotational bodies. These are bodies
resulting from the rotation of a portion of a 2D function around an axis.

Please note that rotations around an axis other than either x- or y-axis
are considered highly experimental at this point.
